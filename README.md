# Design Pattern Case Study

This repository serves as a case study for implementing various **design patterns** and leveraging them in different **test automation frameworks**. The primary objective is to showcase how design patterns can simplify code structure, enhance maintainability, and optimize real-world test scenarios.

## Key Features

- 📚 **Design Patterns in Action**:
  - Implementations of popular design patterns like Builder, Singleton, Factory, and more.
  - Real-world use cases tailored for test automation.
- 🛠️ **Test Automation Integration**:

  - Demonstrates how design patterns can streamline test data setup and enhance the readability of test cases.
  - Focuses on tools and frameworks like Jest and others (expandable to other frameworks).

- 🔧 **Scalable Architecture**:
  - Designed to be extendable for future additions of patterns or frameworks.
  - Promotes reusable and maintainable code principles.
